# Week 1 JavaScript Fundamentals

This project contains exercises for Week 1 of the Mobile Application Development course. It covers the basics of JavaScript, including variable declarations, logical operations, and basic string and array operations.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Visual Studio Code and Node.js installed on your computer.

### Installing

Follow these steps to set up your development environment:

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LarryAtGU/mad_ex_week1.git
cd mad_ex_week1
npm install
```

### Files

This project includes several files; three require your attention:

- `questions.js`: The primary file you'll edit, containing instructions for the exercises.
- `data.js`: Provides the data needed for the exercises. Feel free to review it, but please do not modify it.
- `ex.test.js`: Contains test cases. Your goal is to pass all these tests. Avoid modifying this file.

### Check your work

After making changes to `questions.js`, run the following command to test your work:

```bash
npm test
```

If all tests pass (everything is green), congratulations, you've successfully completed the exercises! If there are any failures (red), read the error messages to identify the issue and make necessary corrections in questions.js.
